The United States has promised in recent years that it will cut back on using fossil fuels in order to decrease carbon emissions. How have they delivered on their promise?

It seems the percentage of fossil fuel usage is on a downward turn compared to the total fuel consumption. Renewable energy use is on the rise, while nuclear use has neither grown or diminshed in the years between 2000-2020. While fossil fuel percentage seems to be decreasing, this does not mean total fossil fuel usage is decreasing.
