As summer approaches, most of us will likely swim in the ocean at some point or another. If you are like me, open bodies of water are very frightening. What lurks in the unknown is truly terrifying, and sharks are defintely one of my biggest fears. The bar chart below I created depicts how many shark attacks have occured in the past century on a worldwide scale.

Some takeaways are that after the release of *Jaws*, the amount of attacks in the 70's sharply declines, probably due to people not going in the water as much. In the most recent decades, it seems the reports of shark attacks are increasing but not fatality.
