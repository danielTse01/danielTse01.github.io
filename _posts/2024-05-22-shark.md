As summer approaches, most of us will likely swim in the ocean at some point or another. If you are like me, open bodies of water are very frightening. What lurks in the unknown is truly terrifying, and sharks are one of biggest fears. The bar chart below I created depicts how many shark attacks have occured in the past century on a worldwide scale.

The image below is the raw graph output.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog522_1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

The image below is some touchups to create it more interesting.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog522_2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Some takeaways are that after the release of *Jaws*, the amount of attacks in th 70's sharply declines. In the most recent decades, it seems the reports of shark attacks seem to keep increasing.
