What do young people like to listen to? How about more importantly, what do young liars listen to? In all seriousness, I felt it was interesting to see what sort of music people that lie like to keep repeating on their playlist. The dataset I used surveyed people ages 15-30, and had about 1000 responders.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/blog520.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

In conclusion, if a person you meet really likes to listen to Rock, reconsider.
