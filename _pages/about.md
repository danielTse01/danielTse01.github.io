Hello, my name is Daniel Tse. I am a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Analytics. During my academic journey, I honed my skills in data science and analytics, specializing in the use of R Studio and Python to interpret and visualize complex data sets. Here is a link to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-tse-8685321a4)!

Beyond my academic achievements, I demonstrated exceptional leadership and communication skills through my role in a music non-profit organization at [Musical Empowerment](https://musical-empowerment.org) during my four college years. During my leadship role here, I gained a larger perspective in my own town, where I learned the greatest impact I can create are on the ones closest my community.

Currently, I am focused on continuously improving myself and am eager to gain insights and advice from others. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise in data science to drive innovation and solve real-world problems, always striving to learn and grow in my professional journey.
